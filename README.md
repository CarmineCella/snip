# Snip â€” Scheme Nano-Interpreter Project

Snip is a minimalist Scheme interpreter, built for programmers who love clean syntax and sharp design.  
It supports only the essential core, leaving room for you to build everything else with pure Scheme.

**Features:**
- Pure minimalism
- Lightweight core
- Extendable by writing in Scheme itself

Cut complexity. SNIP your code down to elegance.
