# Snip ‚Äî Scheme nano-interpreter project

> Lightweight, extensible, scientific, and powerful.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Minimalist core:**  
  Written in **~660 lines** of C++, all contained in a **single header file**.
- **Easy to integrate:**  
  Just include `snip.h` ‚Äî no external libraries needed.
- **Homoiconic design:**  
  Code and data share the same structure, like Lisp and Scheme.
- **Tail-call optimization:**  
  Thanks to a carefully crafted `while`-based `eval`, recursion never grows the C++ call stack.
- **Macro system:**  
  Macros can manipulate unevaluated code, allowing elegant new syntactic forms like `let`, etc.
- **Basic scientific library built-in:**  
  Includes:
  - Basic machine learning: `kmeans`, `linear-regression`, `predict-linear`, `knn`
  - Basic signal processing: `fft`, `ifft`, `conv` (fast convolution), `dot`, `pol2car`, `car2pol`
  - Statistics: `mean`, `variance`, `stddev`, `distance`
- **CSV and WAV file I/O:**  
  Read and write multichannel `.csv` and `.wav` files easily.
- **Customizable environment:**  
  Extend the language by simply adding C++ functors.

## üì¶ Philosophy

- **Small is beautiful:**  
  Focus on essential features only.
- **Understandable in a few hours:**  
  Core code is simple enough to read and understand easily.
- **No dependencies:**  
  No Boost, no external math libraries, no complex build systems.
- **Extensible:**  
  You can add primitives, types, and libraries incrementally.

## ‚ö° Example: Hello Snip

```scheme
(define factorial
  (lambda (n)
    (if (eq? n 0)
        1
        (* n (factorial (- n 1))))))
        
(display (factorial 5))
;; => 120
```

---

## üî¨ Example: Basic machine learning

```scheme
(define x (list 1 2 3 4))
(define y (list 2 4 6 8))
(define model (linear-regression x y))
(predict-linear model (list 5 6))
;; => (10 12)
```

---

## üé∂ Example: Signal processing

```scheme
(define signal (range 0 16))
(define transformed (fft signal))
(define reconstructed (ifft transformed))
(display (take 10 reconstructed))
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Building and Using

Simply add:

```cpp
#include "snip.h"
```

in your project.  See [`snip.cpp`](snip.cpp) for a minimal example of embedding the interpreter.

Compile normally with any **C++17 or later** compiler.

## üî• Why Snip?

- Ideal for **educational use**.
- Perfect as an **embedded scripting language**.
- Great foundation for **experimental extensions** (AI, DSP, etc.).
- Tiny footprint but **serious capabilities**.

---

## üåü Roadmap (Possible Future Features)

- Memory pooling for even faster performance.
- Plotting capabilities (generate `.ps` or `.pdf` files).
- More scientific and machine learning primitives (neural networks, clustering, etc.).

# üöÄ Quick Start

Just add `snip.h` to your project, call `make_env()`, and start the `repl()`!
